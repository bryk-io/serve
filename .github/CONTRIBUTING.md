# Contributing

A big welcome and thank you for considering contributing to this project!
Itâ€™s people like you that make it a reality for users in our community.

Reading and following these guidelines will help us make the contribution
process easy and effective for everyone involved. It also communicates that
you agree to respect the time of the developers managing and developing
these projects. In return, we will reciprocate that respect by addressing
your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Code of Conduct

We take our community seriously and hold ourselves and other contributors
to high standards of communication. By participating and contributing to
this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

Contributions are made to this repo via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs).
A few general guidelines that cover both:

- To report security vulnerabilities, please use our [Responsible Disclosure Program](./SECURITY.md)
which is monitored by our security team.
- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- We work hard to makes sure issues are handled in a timely manner but,
depending on the impact, it could take a while to investigate the root cause.
A friendly ping in the comment thread to the submitter or a contributor can
help draw attention if your issue is blocking.

## Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the project, request a new
feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you
create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through
collecting and providing the information we need to investigate and evaluate
you request.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add
your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating
a new one. Adding a [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/)
can also help by indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting
more than just the reporter.

## Pull Requests

PRs to our projects are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your
fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix a known issue **OR** add the functionality in question, not both.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality.
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Include any required and relevant documentation.
- Be accompanied by a complete Pull Request template (loaded automatically
when a PR is created).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes
(e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first.

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account.
2. Clone the project to your machine.
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name.
4. Commit changes to the branch.
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo.
6. Push changes to your fork.
7. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently
review the changes.
